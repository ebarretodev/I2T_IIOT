# I2T_IIOT
## Project to Hackathon IOTA STREAMS

##### Instructions to communicate PLC with Tangle through IOTA Streams Gateway.

This project was supported by [S4B Tech](https://www.s4btech.com.br).


##### Objective:

With the advancement of Industry 4.0 the need to keep data immutably has been increasing.

For that, an application like Tangle can be used a lot, either in a restricted environment, as an internal server, or as a public environment.

Thus, in this project it was used with the principle of sending data and keeping it on the network available through the Streams channel that can be accessed some example on this [link](https://explorer.iot2tangle.io/channel/51ca8cd219130e34072fad3ec43cf35c35d91abfb72518aef83e2e5d1f39d7570000000000000000:af30542dce6d9220e371d97c).
